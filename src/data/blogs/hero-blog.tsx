        Plagiarism isnâ€™t always a malicious act. Sometimes itâ€™s a sign of
        pressure, confusion â€“ or strategic intent. But how do we tell the
        difference, and how do we respond?
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body">
        At higher education institutions across Europe, plagiarism remains a
        growing concern. UNIwiseâ€™s recent white paper,
        <em>Why Students Turn to Plagiarism</em>, explores this issue through
        new data and insights. The paper doesnâ€™t just ask who plagiarises â€“ but
        why.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body">And that makes all the difference.</Typography>

      <Typography variant="h2">
        Two mindsets, one challenge: Reactive vs Proactive plagiarism
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body">
        A meta-analysis of 37 academic studies reveals the five most frequent
        motivations behind deliberate academic misconduct:
      </Typography>

      <ul>
        <li>Poor time management</li>
        <li>Temptation and easy access to answers</li>
        <li>Academic difficulties</li>
        <li>Low perceived risk</li>
        <li>Efficiency gain</li>
      </ul>

      <Typography variant="body">
        These reasons fall into two groups:
      </Typography>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>ðŸŸ¢ Reactive plagiarisers</strong> are overwhelmed â€“ by
          deadlines, workload, or unclear expectations. They plagiarise under
          pressure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ðŸ”´ Proactive plagiarisers</strong> take a calculated risk â€“
          seeing plagiarism as a shortcut to higher grades with less effort.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <Typography variant="body">
        Understanding this distinction matters. Because each group requires a
        different response.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h2">
        Technology isnâ€™t enough. Design for trust and learning.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body">
        Originality by UNIwise is more than a detection tool. Itâ€™s a fully
        integrated part of the WISEflow assessment platform â€“ offering a
        proactive approach to academic integrity.
      </Typography>

      <ul>
        <li>
          âœ… Automatically checks submissions for text similarity and
          paraphrasing
        </li>
        <li>âœ… Shows results directly in the assessment workflow</li>
        <li>âœ… Provides guidance to students on source use and citation</li>
        <li>âœ… Supports teaching, not just policing</li>
      </ul>

      <Typography variant="body">
        This means institutions can respond early to at-risk students â€“ and send
        a clear signal to those who may be tempted to cheat deliberately.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h2">
        Different problems. Different solutions.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body">
        The white paper highlights that each group must be met where they are:
      </Typography>
      <ul>
        <li>
          â€¢ For reactive students, focus on onboarding, study skills, and better
          time planning
        </li>
        <li>
          â€¢ For proactive students, increase the visibility of consequences and
          improve detection methods
        </li>
      </ul>

      <Typography variant="body">
        A one-size-fits-all approach simply wonâ€™t work. Academic misconduct is
        not only a policy issue â€“ itâ€™s a user experience issue.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h2">
        Integrity isnâ€™t just monitored â€“ itâ€™s built.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body">
        At UNIwise, we believe integrity should be embedded in the learning
        process, not treated as an afterthought. Originality helps institutions
        move from reactive control to proactive support â€“ offering clarity,
        consistency, and confidence.
